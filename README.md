# My Learning Log

A log for tracking my progress while I learn about programming and web development! (Initially created as part of a [Learn Teach Code](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode) class.)

**About the learning log app (https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/learning-log):**
This Learn Teach Code project helps students document their learning process on GitHub without requiring any prior experience with Git or GitHub! Using simple web interface, students can post learning log entries right away and then gradually move to using Git and GitHub as they learn more.

## Instructions

### To set up your learning log:

  - Go to github.com/your-username-here/learning-log-template/settings

  - Under "Repository name" at the top of the page, change the name to whatever you prefer! (Example: my-learning-log or daily-notes etc. The usual convention for naming GitHub repositories is to keep it all lower-case and use hyphens to separate words.)

  - Click the "Rename" button next to your new repository name to save it. All done!

### To view your learning log entries:

  - Go to github.com/your-username-here/your-repository-name-here/

  - You'll see a list of your files, one for each log entry. To view them, click on the file name!

### To edit your learning log entries:

  - Go to github.com/your-username-here/your-repository-name-here/

  - In the list of files, click on the file name for the entry you want to edit.

  - On the far right side of the screen, click the small pencil icon (to the right of the buttons that say "Raw", "Blame", and "History").
